# My Neovim config

How to install:
- clone this repo and put it under .config/nvim
- probably change the line `let g:python3_host_prog = '~/miniconda3/bin/python'` to where ever your python installation is (or just remove it)
- in python, install pynvim
- run `:PlugUpgrade` followed by `:PlugInstall` to install all of the plugins.

This repo is mostly for me to be able to share my stuff across my machines, but you are very welcome to copy it if you want.
I would advice against blindly using someone elses config rather than building you own,
but this might be a good starting point that you can modify to suit your needs.
